# OpenPCB
OpenPCB is focused on open-source automated circuit board generation from user specification to Gerber/KiCad files with fully open-sourced tools.
It provides a framework for generating physical hardware layouts directly from Python code, replacing manual placement and routing with algorithmic synthesis.
